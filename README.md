Exercises for use at events. 

## How-to run these notebooks

To run these notebooks, you'll need to:
1. Install TensorFlow
2. Install Jupyter
3. Clone this repo
4. Start Jupyter, and open a notebook

Install TensorFlow by following these [instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/). 

Next, open a terminal and install additional dependencies used by these exercises. Note: if you installed TensorFlow using a virtual environment, be sure to activate the environment before running this command.


```sh 

$ pip install -U numpy jupyter matplotlib pandas Pillow

```

Next, clone the workshops repo.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/workshops
$ cd workshops
```

Finally, start Jupyter.

```sh

$ jupyter notebook

```

You will see output on your terminal to indicate the server is running. Towards the end of the output, you will see a line similar to this.
