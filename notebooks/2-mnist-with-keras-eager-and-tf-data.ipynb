The tf.data API provides tools for working with data (including common functionaltity, like shuffling, batching, etc), as well as high performance utilities (like parallel reads, and pre-fecthing to GPUs) - should you need these down the road. Here, we'll wrap MNIST with tf.data, just to introduce the API. Later, you'll learn how to use tf.data on your own data, say, to read a directory of images off disk.\n","\n","To learn more about tf.data, you can check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHHdyM3NNiA&index=26&list=PLQY2H8rRoyvxjVx3zfw4vA4cvlKogyLNN) talk from the [2018 TensorFlow Developer Summit](https://www.tensorflow.org/dev-summit/).\n","\n","The rest of the code similar to the previous notebook, with three changes. \n","\n","1) Instead of using `model.fit`, we use `model.train_on_batch` as we iterate over our dataset. \n","2) We will create a TensorFlow optimizer to pass to the Keras model.\n","3) We will enable eager execution.\n","\n","### Eager execution\n","Eager execution is a mode for running TensorFlow that works just like regular Python.
